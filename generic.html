					<h1>Roman Space Telescope: Building data pipelines and advancing algorithms for NASA's next flagship mission.</h1>
					<h5>Tools used: Python, Tableau, SQL, matplotlib, pickle, and pandas libraries</h5> 
					</p>
					<h5>Background:</h5> The Roman Space Telescope is NASA’s next flagship mission designed to investigate dark energy, dark matter, and exoplanets. An exoplanet simply refers to a planet that is outside of our solar system. With its novel Coronagraph Instrument, the telescope will perform direct imaging of exoplanets and give us deeper insight into the existence of such distant worlds. Roman is unique for several reasons, the first being its special Coronagraph instrument technology which is currently being built here at JPL. Its Coronagraph technology will block starlight from the host star in order to image the orbiting exoplanet. This technology demonstration phase will last 18 months and after will be open to the wider scientific community for future use. Roman is also unique in that its wide field view is about 100 times that of Hubble and 36 times the size of the James Webb’s Qunintet image. With its novel technology, Roman is expected to observe giant exoplanets in reflected light at unprecedented contrast gain levels.
					</p>
					<h5>Why are post-processing algorithms important:</h5> The main challenge of direct imaging is the removal of the residual starlight from the image. Using just the Coronagraph instrument for imaging is not sufficient as this technology cannot solve errors like image deterioration and surface deformations, so post processing is essential in reducing background noise and successfully detecting the planet within the raw images. It is also necessary to reach the contrast that is needed to demonstrate the technology. Post-processing techniques and the resulting contrast gain numbers for Roman are very important its direct imaging will take place at an unprecedented contrast gain level. This means new observing strategies and processing techniques are needed to overcome potential issues that may arise like static optical errors, surface deformations and misalignments. My project plays an important role in verifying and confirming the efficacy of the Roman Coronagraph instrument and my results are essentially the interface between the engineers and observers working on Roman. Testing post-processing techniques on the last set of simulated data and its contrasts will give the Roman team confidence that they will be able to demonstrate the technology.
					<h5>Project Goal:</h5> The purpose of my project is to advance the current post-processing techniques on simulated data and obtain a metric of success for the Coronagraph Instrument. Our project investigates the OS-11 data for the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph Band 1 which encompasses observations of a bright reference star Zeta Pup and a science target star 47 Uma. Our final deliverable is a contrast table for the processing technique on the OS-11 data and is paramount in verifying and confirming the efficacy of the Roman Coronagraph Instrument before launch.
					</p>
					<h5>Data Reduction: </h5> My data reduction procedure for the simulated data can be summarized by extraction, photon counting, and normalization. The pre-processing procedure of data involves writing a script in python that interpolates 22 data cube images over time. After interpolation, the cubes are compiled into one 4D data cube and passed through an existing photon counting data pipeline. Finally, we ran the post-processing procedure on the data.
