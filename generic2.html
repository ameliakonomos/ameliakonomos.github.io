					<h1>Data Visualization: Using data to explore the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet.</h1>
					<p>
						What is an exoplanet?
						An exoplanet simply refers to a planet that exists outside of our solar system. Our knowledge of the observable universe was radically transformed by the discovery of the first exoplanetary systems less than thirty years ago. We currently know of over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets which gives us great insight into the habitability of the universe and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>How it began:</h5>
						Exoplanets are generally difficult to detect. However, the technique of transmission spectroscopy has made it significantly easier. Transmission spectroscopy is a fancy term for when a planet transits in front of its host star. We can record these dips in light as a function of wavelength. After data reduction, these transmission spectra can reveal an exoplanet’s chemical composition by comparing in and out of transit spectra. This project was completed with the SURF program at Caltech where I was a summer intern. I worked with the Caltech Division of Planetary Sciences under Heather Knutson and Jessica Spake. Heather Knutson's research group had previously observed and recorded the transit of WASP-44b at the Mauna Kea observatory in Hawaii.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>Defining Goals:</h5>
						The goal of our project was to observe the atmosphere of WASP-44b, which had previously never been done. Scientists have methodically observed the atmospheres of other transiting exoplanets, but WASP-44b remained a complete mystery. We were specifically looking for metastable Helium on the 10830 Angstroms line. A detection of Helium can allude to an escaping atmosphere while a non-detection can suggest an atmosphere rich in heavier elements like Carbon. Either way, my overarching goal was to learn more about this distant exoplanet and its atmosphere.

						Aligning my role with the goals and objectives of Caltech, I was responsible for all reduction and processing of the WASP-44b data. Our general method was to use open-source languages to analyze and visualize the extracted datasets containing 32 raw spectra from WASP-44b.

					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>Quantitative Data Reduction:</h5>
						The process of converting and reducing raw data took up most of the project time. We corrected and processed the raw science images in various python routines before running the reduced dataset through a pre-existing NIRSPEC Data Reduction pipeline. The pipeline generated ASCII tables and preview plots. Our reduced data produced a strong helium line, meaning WASP-44b’s host star emits a significant amount of high energy radiation. Finally, after comparing the in-transit and out of transit reduced data, we found there was no significant increase in the 10830 Angstroms line. This essentially means we have a non-detection in the atmosphere of WASP-44b, alluding to an atmosphere rich in heavy elements.

					</p>
					<h5>Reflection:</h5> One of the most fundamental elements of science is the ability to share your knowledge with others. A challenge I encountered in this project was attempting to explain the highly scientific methods used in my project to people outside of the scientific realm, or even those within the realm who had little to no knowledge of exoplanet science. After presenting my preliminary results to my friends and family, I learned that knowledge is best conveyed in a concise manner. It is important to be specific with your words and avoid ambiguity. As someone whose strong suit growing up was never science, I can really empathize with people who feel overwhelmed at the influx of scientific jargon. I like to tell people to ‘explain it to me like a 5 year old’ and that there are no stupid questions! Good communication is paramount in success of any project and the transformation of ideas into actions that benefit the lives of others. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=UfroJuYu2QY&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR3-sH_7dqC1FXvYtshQ8MSo_WGr8uaoeFBlcibF0If9L0H31DIcjq4lb8M">You can watch my UCLA presentation here!</a>

					<h1>Fintech: Analyze a large dataset of fraud in financial payment services.</h1>
					</p><h5>Project background </h5>
					Forage is an open access platform designed to unlock exciting careers for students by connecting them with company-endorsed Virtual Work Experience Programs. I completed the J.P. Morgan Cybersecurity Virtual Experience program. J.P. Morgan says they "service customers from all around the world and keeping their information secure is of utmost importance. However, it is not only the security team’s responsibility to ensure systems are secure; one team simply cannot do it all. Security is everyone’s responsibility. As developers of the underlying systems, software engineers play a critical role by using secure coding practices and having an attacker’s mindset when designing systems. Furthermore, security extends into how developers conduct their day-to-day activities, which is especially relevant given the remote work environment". I have always been interested in the intersection between finance and technology and this project was the perfect opportunity to learn more.
					</p>
					</p><h5>Physics and finance </h5> Before engaging in this project, I knew that physics is a broad and versatile field that can be applied to many different areas, but I did not know the extent in regards to finance. Much of finance and risk management involves analyzing large datasets to extract meaningful insights and inform decision making. As a physics major, I have developed strong analytical skills and an understanding of statistical and computational methods, and I have always been interested in understanding and modeling complex systems. I find finance and financial risk management particularly interesting because they involve analyzing and understanding the risks and uncertainties inherent in financial markets. 
					</p><h5>Project task </h5>
					My task was to analyze a recently acquired dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider. The provided dataset contained five types of transactions including cash-in, cash-out, debit, payment, and transfer. I was assigned several scripts to write and plots to create within my Jupyter notebook and to provide valuable conclusions that ultimately can make the company more secure.
					</p><h5>Data initialization </h5>
					</p> I started by setting up my system by downloading the necessary files that contained the large data set, tools and dependencies. I explored the financial payment services dataset by completing the querying and data visualization exercises provided by Forage. I used the Pandas library to explore and make sense of the provided dataset. I also learned how to write and vizualize queries in such a way that those without technical knowledge can understand and interpret.
					</p><h5>Data analysis </h5>
					<p> The graphs below show my final results and I made several conclusions from the data. The figure in the middle shows a Transaction Types split by Fraud bar chart. I can clearly interpret several things from this data plot. Namely, the frequency of fraud is limited to cash out and transfer transaction types. Furthermore, while fraud is occuring it is minimal, 75 and 72 occurances respectively. All cash in, payment, and debit transactions were non-fradulent. The graph on the right graphs cases of actual fraud as compared to flagged fraud. It is clear that the flagged fraud is missing actual instances of fraud, which is a liability for the company. 
   					</p><h5>Reflection </h5>
					<p>I really enjoyed learning how to apply my data science skills to a new sector. Being able to query and visualize large datasets is so critical in helping companies to make valuable decisions. While this project was challenging, it was equally as exciting and I was able to hone in on my data analytics skills.
