					<h1>Monkeypox Tracking App: Design and prototype a data-driven tracking app.</h1>
					<p>
						In the summer of 2022, I chose a passion project to work on aside from my summer internship. Supporting public health and wellness is a personal mission of mine and I wanted to design and develop a product that would fulfill this.
					</p>
					<p>
						What does the Monkeypox Tracker do?
						As of today, there are 6,326 confirmed Monkeypox cases in the United States and even more troubling is a widespread sentiment of fear and stigma surrounding the virus. I wanted to develop a product that not only combats disinformation but facilitates a safe recovery for those who may be infected. As we saw with the COVID-19 pandemic, infection can be an isolating experience and I wanted to find a way to humanize people with Monkeypox. Monkeypox Tracker is an app that uses API integrated data pipelines to pull real-time data about case numbers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Project Scope:
						Create the foundational functionality of the Monkeypox Tracker App with user friendly UI and API integrated data so that global users can easily access information about the spread of the virus. My minimum viable products are: (1) Share accurate information about the symptoms of Monkeypox, (2) provide users advice on what to do if they develop Monkeypox symptoms, and (3) provide a live tracking map of confirmed cases in the United States.
					</p>
					<span scale="" class="image main"><img src="images/yes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>

						Key Value Drivers:
						Identifying and managing value drivers helps designers to focus on the scope of the product. The key values that drive my Monkeypox tracker app are:
						The central capacity powering the usability of my Monkeypox tracking app is its API integrated data. The tracking interface uses a data pipeline that delivers data in real time so users can get vital information about the virus fast.
						Users want to know fast facts and accurate data about confirmed Monkeypox cases. The quality and value of the tracking app is based on correct and detailed information.

						With everything taken into consideration, I created a running record of the Monkeypox tracking app, as seen above. I used Figma and BravoStudios to prototype my app and create interactive flows to explore user interactions. The above UX/UI design is my final deliverable.

					<h1>GRACE: Developing and curating impactful content.</h1>
					<p>
						I am the president and co-founder of the Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education. We are a youth-led, UCLA student organization focused on genocide prevention. 
					</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/INF.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>As a descendant of a survivor of genocide, I have always been passionate about seeking justice for wrongful acts. In 2020, I co-founded the GRACE at UCLA to cultivate a student-led community of passionate individuals dedicated to amplifying and empowering survivors of genocide. Our organization has led several fundraising campaigns for survivors of various genocides. </p>
					<p> If COVID-19 taught us anything, it was the power of the internet. GRACE utilizes our online platform full of art, literature, and research to accurately relay information and awareness surrounding genocide. We believe it is important to diversify the experience of survivors through visual and auditory content. Our personal relations and research committees are dedicated to engaging our audience on worldwide issues with webinars, panels, speaking events, and most importantly social media design and campaigns.
