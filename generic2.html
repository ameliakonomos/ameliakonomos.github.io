					<h1>GRACE: Developing and curating impactful content.</h1>
					<p>
						I am the president and co-founder of the Genocide Relief, Awareness, and Community Education. We are a youth-led, UCLA student organization focused on genocide prevention. 
					</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/INF.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>As a descendant of a survivor of genocide, I have always been passionate about seeking justice for wrongful acts. In 2020, I co-founded the GRACE at UCLA to cultivate a student-led community of passionate individuals dedicated to amplifying and empowering survivors of genocide. Our organization has led several fundraising campaigns for survivors of various genocides. </p>
					<p> If COVID-19 taught us anything, it was the power of the internet. GRACE utilizes our online platform full of art, literature, and research to accurately relay information and awareness surrounding genocide. We believe it is important to diversify the experience of survivors through visual and auditory content. Our personal relations and research committees are dedicated to engaging our audience on worldwide issues with webinars, panels, speaking events, and most importantly social media design and campaigns. You can view our Instagram platform <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grace.ucla/">here.</a></p>
