							<h1>Data Science Project: Exploring best coffee joints in Westwood.</h1>
							<p>Believe it or not, caffeine calms my mind. I dont think there is a day that goes by at UCLA where I miss my morning cup of coffee. Lucky for me, there is a slew of cute cafés in Westwood village, and I have yet to explore them all. I wanted to put my debilitating caffeine addiction to good use with this independent data science project and aggregate the opinions of my fellow peers on the topic of coffee. What is the best coffee joint in Westwood?  </p>
							<p> <h5>1. Defining my data sources</h5></p>
							<p>I used both Google Maps and Yelp to data scrap the top 14 coffee shops in Westwood, reviewing top ratings and crowd-sourced reviews. I wanted to include the opinion of my peers as well, so I ran an additional survey to gather data and information about the best coffee shops in Westwood from 15 UCLA students. I combined and compiled the data from online and from UCLA students into one congruent data source.  </p>
							<p> <h5>2. Webscrapping and compilating data</h5>My data from the web-mapping platforms was scrapped using Webscaper Chrome Extension. This data along with my UCLA student data was linked and exported into a single CSV file. The relevant parameters were listed according to source, including whether or not the shop includes wifi, outlets, and its proximity to UCLA campus.  </p>
							<p><h5>3. Tableau Prep and Execution</h5> My data was imported into Tableau Prep and scanned for error. Only data relevant to analysis was exported to the map. I used Tableau Desktop to run data visualizations based on my key parameters listed above. These key variables are what I and my fellow peers consider to constitute a 'top-tier' Westwood café. Finally, I uploaded and published the Tableau Dashboard and embedded the HTML from the Tableau documentation. </p>
							<p><h5>Analysis</h5></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/yas.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/last.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							There is a positive correlation between cafe rating, presence of outlets, and option of wifi. The shops with the highest ratings either have wifi, outlets, or both, which confirms my theory of key variables for UCLA students. One outlier in my data is the Starbucks. The location has wifi but its ratings are exceptionally low. This is likely due to the fact that it is the farthest datapoint on the map and is not frequented by UCLA students. There is a secondary Starbucks much closer to the village but it was not included in the dataset. This would explain the exceptionally low ratings for the Starbucks data point. Thus, we can consider proximity to UCLA as a good indicator for high ratings.
							<p><h5>Final recommendation</h5></p>
							<p>Through this data analysis, I have come up with a final reccomendation factoring in the key variables of rating, proximity to UCLA, wifi, and outlets. All of the data analysis supports Upside Down as the best coffee shop in Westwood village. With it being a five minute walk from campus, its free outlets and wifi, and its affordable prices, I highly recommend you visit next time you find yourself in Los Angeles.

					<h1>Radio Engineering: Building and processing home-made radios.</h1>
					<p> <h5>Project context</h5></p>
					<p>In the spring of 2022, I participated in a physics laboratory. By far, my favorite project in the course was the design and construction of two working radios. I have always loved to build, create, and fix things so this project was a great opportunity to enhance my electrical engineering and programming skills.
					<p> <h5>Defining project background and goals</h5></p>
					</p>
					During the late nineteenth century, renowned scientists Maxwell and Hertz discovered that oscillating electromagnetic fields could produce self-propagating waves traveling at the speed of light. It was later discovered that light itself is a self-propagating wave. A radio wave is just a form of an electromagentic wave, and its transmitter can generate and propagate radio signals with information through the air. These signals can be picked up by the reciever of a radio through electric conduction. Our project plan was to design and construct two separate radio designs, one with an LC circuit, diode, and antennea with the other being an MK484 AM Radio Integrated Circuit. Ultimately, our final project goal was to record local radio station frequencies and perform data analysis. 
					</p>
					<p> <h5>First Radio construction</h5></p>
					Our avaliable equipment included a radio kit, amplifier components, resistors, capacitors, and volt batteries. We built our first radio design as the simple crystal radio consisting of a LC circuit, antenna, and diode. We first built the inductor with a ten foot piece of wire, wrapping it tightly in a coil. Electrical tape was used to hold the coil together and in place. In order to remove the insulation on the coils, we had to use sandpaper at the two ends of the copper wire. We connected the capacitor and inductor in parallel and then connected a diode and speaker onto the breadboard. 
					</p>
					<p> <h5>Second Radio construction and its audible signal</h5></p>
					Our improved design on the simple crystal radio integrated an MK484 AM Radio Integrated Circuit. With this second radio design and good grounding, we were able to receive audio from two sources.  The first was KTNQ 1020 AM from the city of industry area, in Spanish. The other radio signal was KLAA-AM Angels from the Orange County. Our frequencies were measured at 1.63MHz and 1.98MHz respectively.
					</p>
					<p> <h5>MYDAQ Acquisition system analysis</h5></p>
					Our final analysis was done on Jupyter notebook by inputting our sound signals into the myDAQ acquisiton system, essentially using the DAQ assistant interface to record and save our radio sounds to the laptop system. We completed several cross-checks and data plotting which can be found in my Github.
